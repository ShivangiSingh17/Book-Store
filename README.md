# Book-Store Management System
### EXISTING SYSTEM:
This system is an https://github.com/ShivangiSingh17/Book-Store.gitattempt to overcome the present inefficient and time consuming process of locating, reserving and purchasing quality reading materials available in the store. Currently, clients have to go through a time consuming process to perform aforementioned tasks which cause waste of labor and firms resources. Through our automated book store solution, we provide an easy way of searching, reserving and purchasing of books.

### PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The Bookstore Management System is to automate all operations in a bookshop. Generally it includes the Order Processing, Stock Management and Accounts Management. The main objective of this project is to manage the details and information of Inventory, books, sales, stock etc. The purpose of the project is to build an application to reduce the manual work for managing the inventory. It tracks all the details regarding receipts, sales and stocks.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED:
#####Front-end: Java using Swing
#####Back-end: MySQL


### FUNCTIONS PROVIDED:
1.  Searching facilities based on receipts, sales, stocks etc

### IMPLEMENTATION:
There are two views of this BookShop:
##### 1.  Administrator View:
The administrator controls all the activities. He has  a username and password through which he enters the admin view. It has the following functions:
          
          1.  Add/Delete/Edit a Category.
          2.  Add/Delete/Edit a Book
          3.  Add/Delete/Edit a User

          3.  Search/Display


##### The project will be implemented using OOPs concepts such as Data Abstraction (used for hiding the details of the Admin view from the User, and for only displaying the essential features to the user), Encapsulation (all the attributes and functionalities of the project will be wrapped within the required classes), Inheritance (the features will be inherited from one class to another, the functionalities of Search class will be present in both Admin as well as User class and so on), Polymorphism (the add and delete functions can be overridden and overloaded for the user and admin classes), Association, Aggregation and Composition (different attributes and functionalities will have different relationships with each other).  


### CONCLUSION:
This project can be easily implemented under various situations. We can add new features as and when we require. Reusability and flexibility is possible.
